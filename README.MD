## About
In this repository a modpack of Videman server is stored, grouped to server and client parts.

## Work algorithm:
1. Someone of us adds new mods and pushes changes to this repo.
2. Then person who publishes modpack, selects mods, for client and server, from directory `mods`.
    1. Additionally, for server part, the person selects mods from `mods/server`.
    2. And for client from `/mods/client`.
3. `config/` directory folows the same rules.

## For what
This work strategy need to keep modpack structure clean.
